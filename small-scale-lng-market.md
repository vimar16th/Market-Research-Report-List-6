<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small-Scale LNG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small-scale LNG market encompasses two primary types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals are facilities where natural gas is cooled to become liquid for easier transport and storage, often catering to small producers and markets. In contrast, regasification terminals convert LNG back into its gaseous form, enabling distribution to end-users. Both terminal types play crucial roles in expanding access to natural gas, particularly in remote areas and regions lacking extensive pipeline infrastructure.</p></p>
