<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray Imaging Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Detector</li><li>Indirect Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The X-ray imaging detector market is primarily divided into two types: direct and indirect detectors. Direct detectors convert X-ray photons into electrical signals using materials like amorphous selenium, providing high spatial resolution and efficiency. Indirect detectors, on the other hand, utilize a two-step process where X-ray photons are first converted into light using scintillators, then into electrical signals via photodetectors. Each type has its advantages, with direct detectors favoring clearer images and indirect detectors often being more cost-effective.</p></p>
