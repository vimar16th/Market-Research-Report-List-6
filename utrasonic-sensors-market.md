<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Utrasonic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Proximity Sensors</li><li>Retro-Reflective Sensors</li><li>Through Beam Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic sensors are classified into three main types based on their operational principles. Proximity sensors detect objects within a specific range without requiring a direct line of sight, making them ideal for detecting nearby obstacles. Retro-reflective sensors use a reflective surface to bounce ultrasonic waves back to the sensor, enabling precise object detection at varying distances. Through beam sensors consist of a transmitter and receiver positioned across from each other, detecting interruptions in the sound waves to indicate the presence of an object.</p></p>
