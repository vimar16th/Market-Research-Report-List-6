<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pedicle Screw Fixation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyaxial</li><li>Monoaxial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pedicle screw fixation is a common surgical technique used to stabilize the spine. There are two main types of pedicle screw fixation markets: polyaxial and monoaxial. Polyaxial screws allow for greater flexibility in screw placement and angulation, making them ideal for complex spinal deformities. Monoaxial screws, on the other hand, are straight screws that provide more direct control over the screw trajectory. Both types of screws have their own advantages and are used based on the specific needs of the patient and the complexity of the spinal condition.</p></p>
