<p><p>Enasidenib is a targeted therapy primarily used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with specific genetic mutations. This drug functions as an inhibitor that selectively targets the isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) enzyme, leading to the reduced production of 2-hydroxyglutarate and restoring normal differentiation of myeloid cells. Its effectiveness in managing AML, particularly in relapsed or refractory cases, has positioned Enasidenib favorably in the oncology market.</p><p>The Enasidenib Drugs Market is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing incidences of AML and advancements in personalized medicine. The demand for targeted therapies that offer fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy is propelling market expansion. Additionally, ongoing clinical trials and research into combination therapies are likely to enhance treatment options and efficacy, further contributing to market growth.</p><p>Furthermore, the focus on early diagnosis and the rise of precision medicine are key trends influencing the market. As healthcare systems continue to prioritize innovative cancer therapies, the Enasidenib Drugs Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.2% during the forecast period, reflecting the increasing reliance on targeted cancer treatments.</p></p>
