<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>ICD</li><li>BI-V ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cardiac devices market includes several key types: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), and biventricular ICDs (BI-V ICDs). Pacemakers regulate heart rhythms by delivering electrical impulses, primarily for patients with bradycardia. ICDs monitor heart activity and deliver shocks to correct life-threatening arrhythmias. BI-V ICDs, designed for patients with heart failure, provide both pacing and defibrillation, targeting ventricular synchronization. These devices enhance patient quality of life and safety, addressing various cardiac conditions effectively.</p></p>
