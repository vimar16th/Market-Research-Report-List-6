<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Seat Belt Pretensioners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Electrical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive seat belt pretensioners are safety features designed to tighten seat belts during a collision, reducing the risk of injury. There are two main types of pretensioners: mechanical and electrical. Mechanical pretensioners use a pyrotechnic charge to tighten the seat belt, while electrical pretensioners use a motor to retract the belt. Both types work to quickly remove slack from the seat belt, securing the passenger in place before the full force of the collision is felt.</p></p>
