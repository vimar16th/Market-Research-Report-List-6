<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unwashed ATS</li><li>Washed ATS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Systems come in two main types: Unwashed ATS and Washed ATS. Unwashed ATS involves collecting and reinfusing the patient's blood without any additional processing, making it a quicker and simpler method. On the other hand, Washed ATS involves processing the collected blood to remove impurities before reinfusing it back into the patient, minimizing the risk of complications such as infection or allergic reactions. Both types offer benefits depending on the specific needs of the patient and the surgical procedure involved.</p></p>
