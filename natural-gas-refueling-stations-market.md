<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Refueling Stations Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CNG</li><li>LNG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural Gas Refueling Stations are categorized into two market types: Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). CNG stations compress natural gas to store it in high-pressure tanks, making it suitable for smaller vehicles like cars and buses. On the other hand, LNG stations liquefy natural gas by cooling it to extremely low temperatures, enabling it to be stored and transported easily for use in larger vehicles like trucks and ships. Both CNG and LNG refueling stations play a vital role in advancing the adoption of natural gas as a cleaner alternative fuel.</p></p>
