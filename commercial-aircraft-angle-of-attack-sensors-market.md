<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aircraft Angle of Attack Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vane angle of attack sensor</li><li>Zero pressure angle of attack sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial aircraft angle of attack sensors market primarily includes two types: vane angle of attack sensors and zero pressure angle of attack sensors. Vane angle of attack sensors utilize a movable vane to measure the angle of airflow relative to the aircraft's wings, providing critical data for flight control and safety. In contrast, zero pressure angle of attack sensors measure pressure differences in the airflow without relying on moving parts, offering a more compact and potentially more reliable solution. Both types are essential for enhancing aircraft performance and safety.</p></p>
