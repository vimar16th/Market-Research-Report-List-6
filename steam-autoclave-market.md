<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Autoclave Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-vacuum Autoclave</li><li>Steam Flush Autoclave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steam autoclaves are widely used in industries such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals for sterilization purposes. There are two main types of steam autoclaves - pre-vacuum autoclave and steam flush autoclave. Pre-vacuum autoclaves use a series of vacuum pulses to remove air from the chamber before introducing steam, ensuring that sterilization occurs more effectively. On the other hand, steam flush autoclaves feature a steam generator that continuously flushes the chamber with steam, offering a quick and efficient sterilization process.</p></p>
