<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Large Bore Vascular Closure Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Closure Devices</li><li>Active Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Large Bore Vascular Closure Devices market comprises two main types: passive closure devices and active closure devices. Passive closure devices rely on the body's natural healing processes to seal the vascular access point, often using materials that encourage tissue coagulation. In contrast, active closure devices employ mechanical or technological means to expedite closure, such as sutures or external clamps. Both types aim to reduce procedural complications, enhance patient recovery, and facilitate faster mobilization post-intervention.</p></p>
