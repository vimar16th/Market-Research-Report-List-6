<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimode Dark Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step-index Multimode Fiber</li><li>Graded-index Multimode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multimode dark fiber market is primarily categorized into two types: step-index multimode fiber and graded-index multimode fiber. Step-index multimode fiber features a uniform refractive index, allowing light to bounce off of a core and cladding boundary, making it suitable for short-distance applications. In contrast, graded-index multimode fiber has a varying refractive index, which reduces modal dispersion, enhancing performance over longer distances. Both types are essential for expanding communication networks, supporting high-bandwidth applications and data transmission.</p></p>
